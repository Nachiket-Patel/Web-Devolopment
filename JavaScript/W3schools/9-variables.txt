variables in JavaScript can define 4 ways

1: using var
2: using let
3: using const
4: using nothing

var is old method 1995 to 2015.
let and const are introduced in 2015.

let: is used for values that change, it is block variable that can only access within its block.
const: is used for values that does not change. const is not block variable that can access out of its block.

Variables in JavaScript are case-sensitive so Hello and hello are different variables.

You can declare as many as variables in one line.

If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
let x = "5" + 5 + 2

$ and _ are consider valid for variables.
