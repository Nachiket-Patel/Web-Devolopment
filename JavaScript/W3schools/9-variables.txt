variables in JavaScript can define 4 ways

1: using var
2: using let
3: using const
4: using nothing

var is old method 1995 to 2015.
let and const are introduced in 2015.


let: is used for values that change.
it is block variable that can only access within its block.
Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.


const: is used for values that does not change. const is not block variable that can access out of its block.
Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:
A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp

The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object


Variables in JavaScript are case-sensitive so Hello and hello are different variables.

You can declare as many as variables in one line.

If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
let x = "5" + 5 + 2

$ and _ are consider valid for variables.
