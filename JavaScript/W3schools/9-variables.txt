variables in JavaScript can define 4 ways

1: using var
2: using let
3: using const
4: using nothing

var is old method 1995 to 2015.
let and const are introduced in 2015.


let: is used for values that change.
it is block variable that can only access within its block.
Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.


const: is used for values that does not change. const is not block variable that can access out of its block.
Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
Variables defined with const have Block Scope.


Variables in JavaScript are case-sensitive so Hello and hello are different variables.

You can declare as many as variables in one line.

If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
let x = "5" + 5 + 2

$ and _ are consider valid for variables.
